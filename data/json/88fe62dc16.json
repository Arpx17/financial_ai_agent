Crawley following an eight-month investigation into multiple allegations of fraud, forgery and financial deception totaling more than $1 million, according to police. The investigation originated with the U.S. Department of Agriculture and was transferred to the Prairie Grove Police Department, according to the news release. It began with a report involving the forged endorsement of a check for $160,362 that Crawley tried to deposit into his personal bank account without the required authorization, the release states. Investigators then interviewed dozens of individuals and entities following the initial incident and uncovered evidence Crawley used deceptive practices to get money and services from at least 24 victims, according to the release. Police said Thursday they have received an additional 14 calls since sending out the release. Victims range from individual law firm clients and small businesses to banks, property managers and agricultural enterprises, the release states. Allegations include the use of deception and fraudulent misrepresentation to obtain funds, failure to repay debts and the misappropriation of money. Some common themes emerged among the victims during the investigation, according to police. Many victims reported Crawley used his professional status and charismatic personality to gain trust, create an illusion of financial stability and ultimately exploit those relationships for personal gain, the release states. In some instances, Crawley is accused of using money obtained from one individual or business to repay obligations to others, creating a pattern of financial misrepresentation and unsustainable transactions. “This case represents a significant breach of trust and a deliberate abuse of professional authority,” Prairie Grove Police Capt. Jeff O’Brien said in the news release. “Mr. Crawley used his reputation and community involvement to create opportunities for fraud, impacting individuals and organizations across Northwest Arkansas, Oklahoma and Missouri.” State charges currently pending against Crawley include forgery and theft of property, according to the release. Additional charges may follow as the investigation continues in cooperation with local, state and federal authorities. Police are asking anyone who believes they may have been a victim in this case to contact the Prairie Grove Police Department at (479) 846-3270. Crawley, 36, of Main Street in Bentonville, was being held in the Washington County Detention Center on Thursday in lieu of $5,000 bond. The Prairie Grove Police Department, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington County Prosecutor’s Office and the Farmington Police Department were involved in the investigation, the release states.
