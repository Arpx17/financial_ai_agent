  "content": "Copy article link April 1 marked a new day for the Northeast Texas Municipal Water District (NETMWD) — or at least it would seem. Executive Director Wayne Owen from Tarrant County was gone. Two weeks prior at a NETMWD board meeting, the directors authorized entering into a and named Osiris Brantley, its chief financial officer, as interim general manager. How appropriate that these changes were made effective on April Fools’ day. The directors may have severed their relationship with Owen, but they are still operating in the dark. No agreement was presented, nor were its terms discussed, at the aforementioned board meeting. So how did the board determine the terms of the agreement, including severance pay of $140,000? Yet it was consummated without public deliberation and action. A job application was posted on the NETMWD website for the general manager’s position March 31. The qualifications are markedly different than those posted in 2021 for the same position. Some qualifications are broader and some are more narrow. Strangely, Walt Sears, who served in the position for more than two decades, would not even qualify for the job now. How were the qualifications determined? Who authorized the job posting and determined the deadline for applications? Were these responsibilities delegated to Ms. Brantley? Did a district employee frame the qualifications to fit himself or herself for the highest paid position of $220,000? Maybe. Did the board engage in an illegal “walking quorum” where a director engages a quorum of directors privately, querying their thoughts and polling their positions on these matters? Most likely. This commonly known loophole, used to circumvent the Texas Open Meeting Act, was closed in 2019 when Senate Bill 1640 became law to ensure greater transparency of governmental bodies. Why is this important? Because it shows the directors are recalcitrant. Space will not allow for relating other incidents of defying laws, but this much is clear: The directors treat the NETMWD as a private club, and so far, with impunity. They refer to it as “the company” or “the business.” Until recently, few people, or none at all, would attend their meetings. When some did attend in the past, they would often go into an executive session, closed to the public, for a portion of the meeting. Over the last two years, these executive sessions have averaged 34 minutes per meeting. Not only have NETMWD directors hidden their deliberations and actions, they have hidden their contact information. Take a look at the NETMWD website. There is not one email address for a director or indication who the directors are or what city appointed them. The directors are nowhere to be seen, except if you dig deep, download and read an agenda or minutes of a board meeting, or find a letterhead. Thomas Jefferson wrote: “When a man assumes a public trust, he should consider himself as public property.” The manner in which the NETMWD directors consider themselves defies this description, and their maneuverings display contempt for such an ideal. Now to return to the job posting. Where was the job advertised? Not where you might expect strong qualified applicants — such as the Texas Rural Water Association’s job board. Why are the applications due in only nine business days, on April 11? Perhaps the brief opportunity to apply for the job is designed to limit applicants and favor Ms. Brantley. The board is no doubt impressed with her obsequious efforts to salvage the . Until recently, the seven city councils appear to have had a nonchalant attitude toward the water district. The prevalent attitude should be vigilance — which would entail asking their directors probing questions, demanding explanations, and in regard to the job posting, demanding a full, open, professional job search for such an important position. If city councils just go along to get along with the directors, they perpetuate the private country club mentality and are complicit with good ole boys, who flaunt laws and hide from the public. — David Simpson, an Avinger resident, is a former Republican member of the Texas House of Representatives for District 7 representing Gregg and Upshur counties.
