  "content": "By The moms behind Big Little Feelings, a wildly popular that gives actionable, relatable parenting advice, aren't afraid to talk about the messy side of motherhood. Its founders, parenting coach Kristin Gallant and licensed marriage and family therapist Deena Margolin, often share experiences from their own marriages to show that if it feels impossible to balance a relationship and young kids ... that's because it is. “We’ve talked to literally millions of parents of young kids, and the person with the perfect marriage you see on Instagram doesn’t exist,” Gallant, a mom of three, tells TODAY.com. “It doesn’t mean that everyone’s marriage is crumbling. But every marriage with young kids has an area of struggle. Every single one.” “You go to the internet and all you see are happy, smiling families, which honestly triggered the s--- out of me when things were so bad in my marriage,” adds Margolin, who is pregnant with her third child and has opened up about being on the brink of divorce at one point. “Just knowing that this is a very common and natural part of the journey for a lot of us takes the loneliness and the shame out of it.” Finding an 'absolute miracle' for the mental load “Motherhood rocked me,” says Gallant, who coped with postpartum anxiety after the births of her children: Lulu, 8, Junie, 6, and Fox, 2. While she says her husband was “very supportive” at the time, trouble brewed as their family grew. By the time she had her third child, conceived via IVF, Gallant felt confident as a mother. She knew how to tackle bouts of RSV, food allergies and endless whining. But as her mom confidence grew, her marital bliss declined. “I think the just crushes marriages. There’s less space for partnership when there’s more being thrown into your brain,” she says. “Suddenly you can never have a conversation,” she continues. “Suddenly you have five people’s worth of clothing. You have three different schedules to keep up with. I’m the one who has to carry everything. It’s all on me.” To cope, she tried eating better, she tried exercising, she tried meditation ... but nothing was curbing her panic attacks or multiday migraines. Adding mental health medication to the mix was the “absolute miracle” she needed, she says. It isn’t a cure-all for the mental load, but it helps Gallant shrug off setbacks. “I wish that I would have been put on Lexapro the minute I had a child, if not sooner,” she says. I wish that I would have been put on Lexapro the minute I had a child, if not sooner.” Kristin Gallant Even so, between juggling work, daycare for her toddler and extracurriculars for the older kids, Gallant struggles to find time for herself, which in turn affects her relationship with her husband. “It’s so hard, I think, to really find genuine connection, because we’re just at capacity,” she admits. Getting past the 'rock-bottom moment' Margolin remembers taking a pre-birth class with her husband before they became parents. They are raising 3- and 4-year-old sons and are expecting a third in August. “I remember laughing to each other like, ‘We got this down. We love each other so much. We are soulmates,’” Margolin recalls about preparing for their first. “We just kind of thought that it would organically fall into a system and were going off good vibes.” Instead, Margolin shouldered the invisible load and felt completely underwater. “No matter how many conversations we had, we couldn’t actually make changes that were sustainable; that were really lightening the load for me,” she recalls. Part of the issue, she says, was the fact that her husband “wasn’t motivated yet to show up and really work on this partnership. It was easier to just keep working, stay busy, you know, push through.” The couple ended up having a second baby fairly quickly, which only exacerbated their marriage problems. When her husband didn’t meet her halfway, Margolin “closed down.” Margolin realized that might be the best option for her family. Her husband’s “rock-bottom moment” was when she told him it might be better for them to part ways. The thought of losing the family he always wanted motivated him to return to personal therapy and eventually couples therapy together. Margolin admits that the process was difficult “because I had one foot out at that point.” Luckily, therapy helped them “find each other again and grow as parents to become an actual team.” Today, Margolin is pregnant with her third son, and because the newborn phase has historically been the most difficult for the pair, they proactively returned to couples therapy. Their goal is to “build systems now that are different than the last go round” to help them take care of themselves so they can show up for each other. Embracing 'beauty in the chaos' of parenthood To make it through low points of marriage, both women say it's essential to fill your cup. “Taking care of (myself) first is the best thing that has happened to my marriage after having three kids,” says Gallant. Now, Gallant and her husband find time to do activities to rekindle their spark — even if that means attending a concert they might feel too exhausted for. For Margolin and her husband, time apart to “be ourselves for a little bit” gives them the energy and bandwidth they need to tackle family life as a team. They also divide up household tasks and refrain from micromanaging one another, allowing them to better enjoy their time together. “I think we have to sort of embrace some of the beauty in the chaos,” says Gallant. “Life and marriage has to look a little different right now and that has to be OK.” Rosie Colosi lives in New Jersey and is a reporter for TODAY Parents.
