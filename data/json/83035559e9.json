FMC's portfolio of distinctive pheromone products for row crops leads a new era in crop protection and pest management PHILADELPHIA , April 10, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- FMC Corporation FMC , a leading agricultural sciences company, today announced it has received registration in Brazil for Sofero™ Fall pheromone targeting fall armyworm ( Spodoptera frugiperda ). Sofero™ Fall is the first in the company's lineup of distinctive pheromone products for row crops offering growers a novel approach to sustainably control pests, manage resistance and boost productivity. \"The registration of Sofero™ Fall in Brazil marks a significant milestone in our efforts to bring high-performance, sustainable crop protection solutions to growers,\" said Ronaldo Pereira , FMC president. \"We are excited to provide growers with a powerful new tool in the battle against fall armyworm. Fall armyworm has developed resistance to many traditional insecticides, and growers are seeking alternative solutions to complement their existing practices. Sofero™ Fall offers an efficient and sustainable way to overcome mounting resistance challenges and enhance the performance of their pest management programs.\" Sofero™ Fall features an innovative mode of action based on mating disruption. This breakthrough technology harnesses the powerful signals of pheromones to naturally disrupt the mating cycles of fall armyworm, preventing it from reproducing. By breaking the pest cycle before the next generation can emerge, Sofero™ Fall protects crops in the early stages of development, reducing damage and supporting healthy growth. The unique, sprayable formulation leverages FMC's proprietary microencapsulation technology to improve stability and extend its effectiveness, optimizing performance and providing growers with longer-lasting protection. Sofero™ Fall is the first product to launch under FMC's global Sofero™ pheromone solutions brand. The Sofero™ portfolio of products will target destructive pests in key crops including rice, corn, cotton and soybeans. Sofero™ pheromone solutions are designed to be used as part of an integrated program, combined with synthetics, biologicals and precision technologies to improve operational efficiency. \"Sofero™ pheromone solutions inspire a new way to think about crop protection – one that is focused on prevention over treatment,\" continued Pereira. \"With our extensive portfolio and global reach, FMC is uniquely positioned to bring these game-changing solutions to growers around the world, creating a more sustainable future for agriculture while solving real problems in the field.\" Registration for Sofero™ Frugi pheromone, which also targets fall armyworm, is pending in Mexico and anticipated in 2027.
