  "content": "The latest tariffs introduced by President Donald Trump have set a universal rate of 10% on imports from the majority of U.S. trade partners, with significantly elevated rates for China. On Wednesday, the President announced via social media that the tariffs on imports from China would be escalated to 125% “effective immediately” due to the “disrespect China has shown towards the World’s Markets.” This new rate adds to the existing 20% fentanyl-related tariff previously placed on China, resulting in a total U.S. tariff rate on Chinese imports reaching an astonishing 145%, as confirmed by a White House official to CNBC. Earlier that same day, China announced its decision to raise the tariff rate on imports from the U.S. to 84%. Many American businesses are already reacting by increasing their prices. Dame, a brand specializing in sexual wellness, has introduced a “Trump tariff surcharge” of $5 on all its vibrators imported from China. Although this fee won’t fully cover the heightened manufacturing costs, CEO Alexandra Fine explained to CNBC Make It that it acts as a signal to consumers about the impact on businesses like Dame. Zoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards Dame’s Instagram post about the surcharge stated, “So we’ve made the tough call to adjust prices to be able to keep bringing you the quality, body-safe products you love.” They added, “We’re adding $5 for now—which doesn’t cover the full cost as we hate to put the brunt of this on you—while we figure out what to do next.” Fine conveyed, “I want people to understand how it impacts us. We are renegotiating again with our manufacturers. We are adjusting our logistics. We are changing our inventory.” Zoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards According to Fine, the rapid changes in tariff rates on China have compelled Dame to repeatedly revisit its manufacturer to negotiate pricing. At the time of this interview on Wednesday morning, the tariff rate on Chinese goods stood at 104%. Other companies are also cautioning consumers about impending price increases. Fashion brand Miista informed customers via email on Wednesday that the additional 20% tariff on European goods would elevate the company’s expenses and likely influence shoppers starting in May. The company emphasized its commitment to keeping price hikes minimal. Brooklyn-based handbag maker Hyer Goods announced on April 3 that its Italian products would experience a 20% price increase starting April 15. The statement remarked, “Raising prices is never something we want to do, but with these new tariffs, it has become unavoidable.” The EU faced a 20% tariff when Washington announced what it termed “reciprocal” duties on trade partners on April 2. Following Trump’s announcement on Wednesday, the tariff has been reduced to 10% for the next 90 days. The fluctuating tariff rates have made it challenging for Dame to provide a stable pricing commitment, Fine explains. Retailers such as Target and Walmart require 60 to 90 days’ notice for any price changes. Additionally, the extensive labor required to renegotiate prices for each store is a costly endeavor, according to Fine, as a price that is feasible today may not hold its value tomorrow. “Ideally, I try not to engage in work that may become irrelevant in two weeks, but it’s not feasible right now. We are making an effort to remain agile and proactive in our decision-making,” she remarks. “It involves significant paperwork.” For the time being, shoppers buying Dame vibrators can anticipate an additional $5 charge, which amounts to a price rise of 3% to 5% based on the product, although Fine is uncertain how the shifting tariffs will impact her business. “One thing every entrepreneur understands is that the stability of the future is always an illusion,” Fine reflects. “You plan based on the information available.” Looking for a new career that offers better pay, more flexibility, or greater fulfillment?
