  "content": "The annual Century Club campaign, organized by Catholic Social Services in Hazleton, is nearing its end, but organizers are appealing to the community to help surpass this year’s goal of $35,000. “This year, our campaign has already raised $29,000, or a little more than 80%, of the goal. All money raised during the Century Club campaign goes toward supporting critical programs right here in the Hazleton area that provide food, shelter and essential services to those in need,” Greater Hazleton Director for Catholic Social Services Danielle Matarella said. Lisa Marie Halecky, 2025 Century Club Chair, says she has seen first-hand the life-changing impact that Catholic Social Services has made in Hazleton, she says the agency not only provides tangible resources but also hope and encouragement. “The impact of someone’s gift to this campaign is immeasurable. I have seen the value of these programs in our community and I cannot imagine not having them. If you can support them, please do,” Halecky said. In 2024, the Saint Joseph’s Food Pantry served a total of 5,904 families, providing nutritious food to those facing food insecurity. In addition to combatting hunger, Catholic Social Services works to shelter the homeless in Hazleton by operating the Divine Providence Shelter, the only shelter in southern Luzerne County that accommodates both adult men and women. The facility offers hot meals every evening as well as a continental breakfast each morning. Case management services also help guests find employment, secure housing and take steps toward long-term self-sufficiency. The Bridge to Independence Program, which provides transitional housing for adults aged 18 to 26 with mental health diagnoses, also benefits the Century Club campaign. The residential program, which can last up to 18 months, focuses on supporting young adults as they work on their mental health while also receiving case management to help them achieve goals and eventually live independently. As a non-profit agency, Catholic Social Services relies on the generosity of individuals, businesses and community groups to continue serving the community’s most vulnerable populations.
