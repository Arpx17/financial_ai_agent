NEW YORK, April 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Levi & Korsinsky, LLP notifies investors in Constellation Brands, Inc. (\"Constellation\" or the \"Company\") STZ of a class action securities lawsuit.

CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning Constellation's full year 2024 fiscal results and financial outlook for 2025 which was based in material part on defendants enhanced focus on improving mix, inventory and sales execution in its Wine and Spirits business, specifically focusing efforts within its premium and above brands to drive more consistent growth. Additionally, defendants made investments in media spend and price promotions as well as adjustments in sales capabilities to support distributor partners. On January 8, 2025 defendants issued a press release announcing the Company's third quarter fiscal year 2025 results.
