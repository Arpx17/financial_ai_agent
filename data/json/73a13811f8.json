While the team, led then by GM Trent Baalke and the previous regime, did make some moves, most notably shipping left tackle Cam Robinson to the , it held on to key playmakers like TE Evan Engram and RB Travis Etienne, players who reportedly from contending teams. With new leadership in place, led by head coach Liam Coen and GM James Gladstone, the Jaguars are kicking off a new era in 2025, and no player outside of Trevor Lawrence, Brian Thomas Jr. and Josh Hines-Allen feel untouchable now just two weeks out from the 2025 NFL Draft. this season as they continue to retool what was a flawed roster under the Baalke regime. Here was his take on the team potentially moving on from its former first-round pick: He ran for just 558 yards last season and was passed on the depth chart by . But he's also a 26-year-old former first-round pick who ran for 1,000 yards in each of his first two NFL seasons and caught 58 passes two years ago, too. He'd cost his new team $6.1 million, which is a lot considering what happened last season. But he'll be a free agent in March and sure looks like a player who might thrive with a change of scenery. The Jaguars picked up Etienne’s fifth-year option in 2024, . When you consider the 2025 running back draft class is expected to be the deepest in decades in terms of pro-ready talent, Gladstone could look to replace Etienne’s bloated cap hit with a fresh prospect on a rookie-scale deal. Jacksonville also has 2023 third-rounder Tank Bigsby in the mix. Bigsby took a major step forward last season, outrushing Etienne while averaging 4.6 yards per carry and scoring seven total touchdowns. He certainly looks the part of an early-down grinder entering his third pro season. Etienne, meanwhile, had a rough 2024 campaign, posting career-lows in attempts (150), yards (558) and touchdowns (2). That slip in production, on top of an over-market contract for 2025, will make him a depreciated asset on draft weekend. Etienne could, however, fetch some value during the regular season from a contender looking to rent a player who posted 58 catches, 1,000 rushing yards and 12 total touchdowns in 2023.
