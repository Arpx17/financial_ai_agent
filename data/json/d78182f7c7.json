Several years later, he is still getting asked about an infamous comment he made after one of his rounds at the Masters. The LIV golfer has never won a green jacket in his career, and some fans think his comments about the Augusta National Course during the 2020 tournament have haunted him as a result. It appears as though, as he enters his 2025 tournament, he is regretting those words. Let's take a look back at DeChambeau's comments and why he's attempting to walk them back. He is still getting 📲 What did Bryson DeChambeau say about Augusta National? In November 2020, DeChambeau said that he thought of Augusta National, one of the most challenging golf courses in the world, as a par-67 course. He was explaining his strategy behind hitting the ball so far off the tee. Here's what he said five years ago, via : “I’m looking at it as a par 67 for me because I can reach all the par fives in two, no problem. If the conditions stay the way they are, that’s what I feel like par is for me.” He elaborated that this perspective stemmed from his ability to overpower the course, particularly the par-5 holes, with his length off the tee, suggesting that his personal par was five strokes below the official par of 72. He added, “That’s not me being bigheaded. I can hit it as far as I want to.” SN's MASTERS HQ: | | The comments were thought to mean DeChambeau was disrespecting the course and its complex layout and hole locations. In the days leading up to his 2025 tournament, he stated that he now regrets the comments he made. “I’ve always since said I don’t regret saying that 67 thing, because I learnt from that experience and it made me a better person,\" Dechambeau told the newspaper. \"But do I wish I hadn’t said it? I do. Really, I do. Because it impacted some people negatively and I don’t want that, no matter how much of a benefit it might have been to me maturing. “I can see that it was disrespectful to some and I’m sorry for that. Boy, it was a humbling experience. But for me, it was simply from a statistical viewpoint and yardage, and looking at, if I’m playing well, I could or should be hitting the greens in two or whatever. “It was motivation for myself and not intended as anything otherwise. I’ve never disrespected Augusta internally. It’s the one I want to win. I stand there on the range and hit shots into the sun as it’s going do,wn and I think to myself, ‘this is heaven, imagine being a part of this history’. And I think I will one day, because I have to think that. If I do, and when I do, it will be the proudest moment of my career.” Dechambeau has expressed regret over the comments in years prior, as well. \"Do I regret [it]? Everybody has a perspective on it,\" DeChambeau . \"I don't think I regret anything. What I do understand is that I have a lot of respect for the course. Because of that statement, [people] think I don't have respect for the course. Are you kidding me? This is one of the greatest golf courses in the entire world, and if anybody thinks I don't have respect for the course, they'd better go check out who I actually am, because it's not accurate one bit.\" What does 'Par 67' mean? DeChambeau calling Augusta National a Par 67, which is five less strokes than what Augusta is, was seen as disrespectful to many. In a way, it sounded like DeChambeau was saying that he thought the course was easier than it seemed or how other golfers played it. Some of the best golfers in the world have described it as quite difficult. Via : Nick Faldo, a three-time major winner at Augusta National, said after winning in 1996, “The course is perfection, and it asks perfection.” Said Gary Player, also a three-time major champion there: “Every shot is within a fraction of disaster; that’s what makes it so great.” [Russell] Henley doesn’t disagree, viewing it with a critical eye. “Augusta will really test your commitment to what you’re doing because it looks like the greens are normal size, but because there are so many runoffs, there are actually very small landing areas,” he says. “And so, if you put yourself on the wrong side of the hole, you’re usually dead. It’s impossible sometimes to get the ball close.” What is par at the Masters? Augusta National has a par of 72, featuring signature holes like Amen Corner, The White Dogwood, and the 18th hole. Has Bryson DeChambeau won a Masters Bryson DeChambeau has never won the Masters. His best finish in the event came last year, when he finished tied for sixth. He missed the cut in 2022 and 2023, and was outside of the top-20 in 2016, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021."
