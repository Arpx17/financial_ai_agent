Tan has major ties to China A report from Reuters revealed today that Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan has extensive investment connections to Chinese companies. Some Chinese companies that Tan has invested in have ties to the Chinese military. The report outlined how Tan has made hundreds of investments in Chinese companies over decades through the investment firm Walden International, a venture he founded in 1987, as well as two Hong Kong-based holding companies, Sakarya Limited and Seine Limited. The most troubling investment, although one that Tan has now exited, was his seed investment in Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp.
