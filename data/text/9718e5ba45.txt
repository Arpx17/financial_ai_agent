The North Adams Public Library and the North Adams Historical Society will co-host a book talk on "Wm. Arthur Gallup and the Arnold Print Works, 1870-1926: An Epic of American Industrialism," at 6 p.m. Wednesday, April 16, in the library's third floor community room, 74 Church St. Samuel M. Trudel, Gallup's great-grandson, will discuss his recently published two-book companion series covering Arnold Print Works history between 1868 and 1942 with a presentation that includes never before published photographs of the company’s operations, samples of original Arnold Print Works fabrics, family photographs, and letters. In his 50 years leading Arnold Print Works, a world-renowned textile manufacturer, Gallup's business and community influence transformed North Adams, and helped usher in the region’s golden age of manufacturing.
