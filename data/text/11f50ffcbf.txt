Apr 10, 2025, 12:00 PM CDT Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan have signed an MOU with the Asian Development Bank and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank to establish a framework for exporting renewable energy to Europe. The plan involves a power line under the Caspian Sea to connect Central Asia to the South Caucasus, and another power line across the Black Sea to reach the European Union. Feasibility studies are set to begin, with ongoing technical work for the Black Sea power cable project and requests for EU special status to expedite regulatory approval and financing. Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan have taken a significant step to line up financing for an ambitious plan to export renewable-energy-produced electricity to Europe, signing a memorandum of understanding with the Asian Development Bank and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. The MOU establishes a “robust institutional and legal framework to facilitate cross-border electricity trade,” according to a issued by the ADB. ADB Director General for Central and West Asia Yevgeniy Zhukov described the agreement as a “defining moment” for the development of a green energy corridor connecting Central Asia and the South Caucasus via a power line stretching under the Caspian Sea. The Caspian project is designed to link up with a similar initiative involving a power line across the Black Sea, enabling the export of electricity to the European Union. “Our joint cooperation will enable us to start feasibility studies of the project soon. Thanks to this regional green energy initiative, Azerbaijan and Central Asia will realize the first trans-Caspian Energy Corridor,” the Azernews agency Azerbaijani Energy Minister Parviz Shabazov as saying following the MOU signing ceremony in Baku on April 4. Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan their trans-Caspian plan last May, under which electricity generated from renewable sources in Central Asia, mainly solar and wind, would be exported to Azerbaijan, which would relay the power onward to the EU. So far, for the completion of the project have been floated. Meanwhile, Azerbaijan, Turkey, Georgia and Bulgaria signed a MOU in early April and are presently engaged in “technical work” to prepare for a feasibility study for the Black Sea power cable project, to an Azerbaijani media outlet. In March, Azerbaijan and Georgia EU special status for the project that would expedite the regulatory approval process and make it easier for Black Sea consortium members to attract financing.
